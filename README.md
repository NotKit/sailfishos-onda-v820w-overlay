# Sailfish OS on Onda v820w
Here are the changed files for running Jolla Tablet firmware on Onda V820w (V3). Most of config and firmware files are extracted from stock Android firmware. This can be used as reference when adapting the firmware to another similar tablet.

See http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?p=1505017#post1505017 for details.

Kernel is based on Jolla Tablet kernel sources with small modifications for getting cameras to work. See https://github.com/NotKit/android-ia_kernel_intel_baytrail
